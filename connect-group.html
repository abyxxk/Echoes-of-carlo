                Birth and Childhood (1991 – 1999):<br>
                Carlo Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London, but his family soon moved to Milan, Italy. From early childhood, Carlo showed a special love for Jesus. Even though his parents were not very religious at first, Carlo would ask to visit churches, pray the Rosary, and attend Mass. His devotion inspired his family to grow in faith as well.

                <p>
                <h3>Growing Faith (2000 – 2005)</h3>
                As a child and early teenager, Carlo’s spiritual life was extraordinary. He made the Eucharist the center of his day, attending Mass daily and spending time in Adoration before the Blessed Sacrament. He often said, “The Eucharist is my highway to heaven.” He also had a strong devotion to Our Lady and prayed the Rosary every day.

                <p>
                <h3>Using Technology for God (2000 – 2005)</h3>
                Carlo had a natural talent for computers. By the age of 11, he taught himself programming, web design, and video editing. He decided to use these skills for evangelization, creating a website that cataloged and explained Eucharistic miracles from around the world. His goal was to bring people closer to Jesus through modern tools like the internet.
            </p>
             <p>
                <h3>A Life of Kindness</h3>
                Carlo was not only prayerful but also full of compassion. He cared for the homeless, helped the poor, and defended classmates who were bullied. He never looked down on anyone and treated everyone with respect and joy. His friends and teachers remember him as cheerful, humble, and always ready to help.
             </p>
             <p>
               <h3>Illness and Offering (2006)</h3>
                At age 15, Carlo was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of leukemia. Despite the pain, he accepted his illness with great faith. He offered his suffering for the Church, for the Pope, and for the people he loved. Carlo remained calm, often saying, “I am happy to die, because I lived my life without wasting a single minute on things that don’t please God.”
             </p>
             <p>
                <h3>Death and Legacy (2006)</h3>
                Carlo passed away on October 12, 2006, in Monza, Italy. He was buried in Assisi, a city he loved because of his devotion to St. Francis. Soon after his death, people around the world began to be inspired by his story and devotion to the Eucharist.
             </p>
                
             <p>
                <h3>Beatification (2020)</h3>
                On October 10, 2020, Pope Francis beatified Carlo Acutis, declaring him “Blessed.” Today, he is honored as the “Patron of the Internet and youth in the digital age.” His life is a reminder that holiness is possible for everyone, even in our modern world.
